## Notebook
The second file in this directory contains the notebook to run an example implementation of the proposed architecture. It is self-contained, and the essential elements of the code are highlighted. To install any dependencies, use the instructions in the first block.

The code is split into several parts:
- Installation
- Configuration
- B-Tree (Derived from https://gist.github.com/benben233/2c8a2a8ab44a7beabad0df1b6658232e)
- Environment
- Feature Extractor
- Helpers
- Example Training Run

For an interested reader, we consider the block, including the feature extractor, as well as the environment, to be the most critical elements.
