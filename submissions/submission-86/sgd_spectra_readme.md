# From SGD to Spectra - Notebook

## Overview

This notebook provides a theoretical exploration of the transition from Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) dynamics to analyzing spectra. It focuses on fundamental theoretical concepts, calculations, and visualizations demonstrating how SGD behavior can be understood and characterized through spectral analysis.

## Contents

- **Introduction to SGD Dynamics**: Explanation of the core concepts and dynamics of stochastic gradient descent.
- **Spectral Analysis**: Theoretical framework connecting SGD dynamics with spectral properties.
- **Mathematical Derivations**: Step-by-step derivations of key theoretical results.
- **Visualization**: Interactive plots illustrating theoretical concepts and results.

## Basic Usage

1. **Dependencies**: Ensure Python and standard scientific libraries (`numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`) are installed.

2. **Running the Notebook**:

   - Open with Jupyter Notebook or compatible IDE.
   - Execute cells sequentially to follow the theoretical development.

3. **Interactive Exploration**:
